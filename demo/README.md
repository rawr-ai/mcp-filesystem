# Demo Directory

This directory provides a sample filesystem structure to demonstrate and test the capabilities of the MCP Filesystem Server. It includes a variety of files and directories that cover common use cases such as:

- Nested directories
- JSON files for read/write/modify operations
- XML files for structure and conversion utilities
- Example files and directories for searching/moving/listing/deletion tests

## Structure

- `nested/`
  - Contains multiple levels of nested folders and a couple of files at deep levels.
- `data.json`
  - A sample JSON file for edit/read/modify operations.
- `sample.xml`
  - An example XML file for conversion and structure queries.
- `info.txt`
  - A plain text file for basic file operations.
- `emptyfolder/`
  - An empty directory to test directory creation and deletion.
- `archive/`
  - Contains archived files and subfolders for operations like moving and recursive listing.

Feel free to add, modify, or delete items in this directory to experiment with and verify server behaviors.
