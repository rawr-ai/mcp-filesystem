This directory contains example files for testing file operations such as copy, move, list, and delete within the MCP Filesystem Server demo.

Files:
- `subdir/old_data.txt` — An archived file deep in a subdirectory, for recursive and nested operation testing.
- `log.txt` — (Consider creating or manipulating this file) A placeholder for recent archive logs or simple text operation tests.

Feel free to add, read, move, or delete files in this directory as part of your MCP server demonstrations.
